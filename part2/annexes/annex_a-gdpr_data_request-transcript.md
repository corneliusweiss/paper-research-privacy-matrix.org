On June 13th 2019, we published the first part of this extensive research on Matrix.org and how they deal with privacy.  
The publication "[Closing words](https://gist.github.com/maxidorius/5736fd09c9194b7a6dc03b6b8d7220d0#closing-words)" contained open questions for New Vector Ltd in their capacity as Data processor of Matrix.org with an explicit request to provide an answer. The questions asked, with *[context]* added for clarity: 

> [Given all which was found in the research], How is [the users', including the authors'] data handled? Are they processed in some way? Which method of lawful processing under GDPR allows for this constant sharing of (meta)data? We hope such questions will be answered to ensure users' privacy is handled appropriately.

The document was also published on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20178267) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kamaxdotio/status/1139267279252787201) as a reply to Matrix 1.0 announcement, among others.  
Matthew answered on June 14th with a [full document review in PDF](https://web.archive.org/web/20190614042212/https://matrix.org/~matthew/Response_to_-_Notes_on_privacy_and_data_collection_of_Matrix.pdf), including Comment 44 on those specific questions which reads:

> the question of how to handle data processing for users of the matrix.org/vector.im identity & integration servers is valid one that we need to tackle.

On June 17th Max repeat his question which was commented on by the Data Processor, but not answered:

> What is the lawful basis under which you process their personal data, since we've illustrated all over the document that you do not get informed consent?

Matthew further reacted on other replies to his comments, but did not address the GDPR Request, which remained opened.

Fearing the GDPR Data request would be ignored, one of the individuals credited in the first research document reminded New Vector Ltd of the still-open request, linking to the research document showing Matthew's involvement.
